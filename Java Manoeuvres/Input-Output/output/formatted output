The printf() method usually has two parts. First, you give the string you want to format as the first attribute.
This string itself includes rules to format it via format specifiers. Some examples of format specifiers are %d, %s, etc.
In the second part, you give the argument list that Java can use to format the string according to format-specifiers.

See the following example to understand the different parts of the printf() function.

System.out.printf("My Name is %s. I was born in %d", "Mike", 1998);

    The first part is "My Name is %s. I was born in %d", where %s and %d are the format specifiers.
    The second part is the argument list: "Mike", 1998 .
