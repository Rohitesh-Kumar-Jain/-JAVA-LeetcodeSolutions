To generate a simple maven project:

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.3 -DgroupId=com.hyperskill -DartifactId=first-maven-app -DinteractiveMode=false 



Building and starting the project: 

Suggested: mvn clean package.




To build a Maven-based project, you should be inside the root directory of your project, at the same level as the pom.xml file. There are several ways to do that:

    Building a project without cleaning the project and without running tests:

mvn compile

    Building a project without cleaning the project, but running tests:

mvn package

    Cleaning a project and then building (with tests):

mvn clean package

    Using install Instead of package:

mvn clean install





To start the project: 

java -cp target/first-maven-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.hyperskill.App
