## The naming convention for type parameters

There is a naming convention that restricts type parameter name choices to single uppercase letters. Without this convention, it would be difficult to tell the difference between a type variable and an ordinary class name.

The most commonly used type parameter names are:

    T – Type
    S, U, V etc. – 2nd, 3rd, 4th types
    E – Element (used extensively by different collections)
    K – Key
    V – Value
    N – Number
