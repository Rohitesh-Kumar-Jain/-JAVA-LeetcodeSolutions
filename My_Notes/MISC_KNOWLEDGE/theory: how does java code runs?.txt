Source Code ----- compilers ---> (Java bytecode) ------ JVM executes ------> low-level (native commands for computer)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


There are special programs called compilers that transform source code into a format that the computer understands.
 This code is called a native code or a low-level code.

A compiler (for example, javac tool for Java or kotlinc tool for Kotlin) translates source code into the intermediate
representation known as Java bytecode, which is stored in files with .class extensions. The bytecode can't be used
with real computers but a special abstract computer called Java Virtual Machine (or JVM) can execute it.


Before running a JVM program, an appropriate distribution of JVM should be installed on the computer. Each operating
system has its special version of JVM. At the same time, JVM can execute a program written in a JVM language regardless
of the type of operating system (or OS) and hardware, so the program that has the same low-level representation can be
run on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and other platforms.


A Java developer writes a program in a text file or files with the .java extension. Then the compiler (usually javac)
translates the program into a .class file that contains the bytecode of the program. JVM starts and executes the
compiled Java program, giving low-level (native) commands to the computer. Here, we use the term 'computer' to
represent an abstract device that can be a server, a PC, a laptop, or even a mobile device. This abstraction includes
an operating system and hardware.





##Java Virtual Machine: 

JVM is a virtual simulation of a physical computer. It executes Java bytecode class files (as you remember, we usually get such files by compiling a source code file of a JVM language).
