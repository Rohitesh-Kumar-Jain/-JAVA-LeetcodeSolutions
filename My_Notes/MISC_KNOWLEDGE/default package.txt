If we do not write a package statement before defining our class, it will be placed inside the default package.
This package has a big disadvantage â€” classes located here can't be imported to classes located inside named packages.

The following class cannot be used in a class located inside packages since there is no package declaration.

// no package declaration

public class Person {
    String firstName;
    String lastName;
}

Do not use the default package for real applications. It is perfectly fine for simple, educational applications,
like "Hello world", but more complex projects will be better in named packages.
