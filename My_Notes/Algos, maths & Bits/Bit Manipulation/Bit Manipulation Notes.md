###Left Shift Operator: 
```(x << y)``` is equivalent to multiplying x with 2^y (2 raised to power y). 


### (>>>)

Unlike the signed right shift (>>), the unsigned (>>>) one does not take sign bits into consideration, it just shifts all the bits to the right and pads the result with zeros from the left. That means that for negative numbers, the result is always positive. Signed and unsigned right shifts have the same result for positive numbers.

```All operators we have considered are evaluated from left to right, just like youâ€™re used to doing.```
