# LeetcodeSolutions
#### NOTE: THIS REPO IS BAISED TOWARDS THE JAVA AND THE SQL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, BUT OPEN TO ALL LANGUAGES. 

This is my collection of mostly Leetcode programming solutions along with other CP solutions. 

Following Contributions are accepted in this repository : 

1) Better solutions for the existing solutions are welcomed and solutions for question that I haven't solved are also welcomed.
2) Your personal Java/MYSQL/ techniques and tricks are welcomed. 

Following Contributions are not welcomed:
1) You can contribute the other programming version of the solution but, pls don't make a separte file for it, instead write your code in that .java file and comment to indicate that this is the for e.g. Python version of the code. 

Rules for file names:
1) The file name should start with it's no, eg: 0345. , 1879. , 0069., 0007., I mean just don't forget to put leading zeros if it's less than 4 digits. 
2) After the no there should be a dot. 
3) After the dot add one or multiple related tags, eg [MAP][DFS][STRING].
	Here's the list of tags.
	[GG] //Good question.
	[DFS]
	[BFS]
	[GRAPH]
	[TREE]
	[EASY] // nothing special or new to learn in this question and it has difficulty level easy.
	[MEDIUM] // nothing special or new to learn in this question and it has difficulty level medium.
	[HARD] // nothing special or new to learn in this question and it has difficulty level Hard.
4) After the tag, write the question's name. 
5) The file can be any language but pls don't modify files, like if you want to add cpp verison to .java file, kindly add the cpp verison below the java version and don't change it to .cpp 


Note : While adding a solution which is not your's, give the author a credit and a link to the original solution. 
Note: You can add manoeuvers in Java language only :sad:
